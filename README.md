# CS571-Project-Image-recoginition-using-PCA-NMF-
First i have generated a single alphabet(image) only for trial,
after that i have generated 4000 images and shuffled them, and printed them
after shuffling i have added random noise to them and plotted noisy image.

After plotting noisy image we have applied PCA(which reduces the dimension) and 
some useful information got lost and we didn't completely retreive original image.

after PCA i have applie NMF and after NMF i got a image a image which is not resembles with original image
and have some noise with it.

so PCA and NMF can not completely recover original image.
